## Guys and Language

It always vexes me ever so slightly when non-native English speakers are scorned for English's lack of a real second-person plural pronoun. It is very probably safe to assume that non-native speakers use "you guys" without any hidden connotations or intentions of delimiting gendered spaces, simply because it is a band-aid in a linguistically precarious pinch (many non-native speakers come from backgrounds with more precise grammar), rather than an in-grown habit of informal language (which may be the case for native speakers).

Misgendering is very common across language barriers. Finnish people regularly misgender people in the third person singular simply because the Finnish language does not gender its third-person pronoun. Native French and German speakers frequently "misgender" inanimate objects because they have gendered pronouns for those. I guess this is just some general encouragement to tread lightly. If gender barriers are a topic for inclusion, so should language barriers. :slightly_smiling_face:
